      My name is Eddie. I'm a Front-end developer. I don't have commercial
      experience now, but I know exactly what I like to do - create web
      applications for users. I didn't take any special courses in programming,
      all my training and practice is Google and YouTube. I think that the most
      important thing for a developer is the ability to solve the task and bring
      the work to the end. <br />
      <br />
      As for practice, I have some pet-projects where you can see my programming
      skills. As for expectations from future work, first of all I would like to
      get experience from more experienced developers and work in a team. And of
      course, to develop in Front-end as a developer.
