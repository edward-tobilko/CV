      Hello everyone :) <br />
      <br />
      My name is Eddie. This year I started to study web development
      (Front-end). Although I don't have any commercial experience, I know
      exactly what I like to do, which is to create web applications for users.
      And although I have not taken any special courses in this regard, I still
      believe that the most important thing for a developer is the ability to
      solve the task and bring the work to the end. Therefore, all my practice
      and training is me and the Internet. <br />
      <br />
      As for practice, I have several home projects where my programming skills
      are manifested. As for expectations from future work, first of all I would
      like to gain experience from more experienced developers and work in a
      team. And of course, to develop in Front-end as a developer.
