      Hello everyone :) <br />
      <br />
      My name is Eddie. I'm a Front-end developer. Although I don't have any
      commercial experience, I know exactly what I like to do - create web
      applications for users. I didn't take any special courses in programming,
      all my training and practice is me and the Internet. But I still think
      that the most important thing for a developer is the ability to solve the
      task and bring the work to the end. <br />
      <br />
      As for practice, I have some pet-projects where my programming skills are
      manifested. As for expectations from future work, first of all I would
      like to gain experience from more experienced developers and work in a
      team. And of course, to develop in Front-end as a developer.
