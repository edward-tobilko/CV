      Hello, everyone!
      <br />My name is Eddie. I'm 29 years old. I started to learn a Web
      Development(Front-end) in this year. It's very interesting to me and I'd
      like to develop and work in the direction of Front-end development.
      <br />At the moment I don't have commercial experience, I have some
      pet-projects on my gitHub page. <br />
      I want to be a part of a friendly and professional team where I could
      develop my skills for front-end development.
